# Leaflet Geolocation and Routing

This repository contains simple demonstrations of using the Leaflet library to achieve two primary functionalities:

1. **Geolocation**: Displaying a user's location on a map and calculating the distance from their location to a fixed address.
2. **Routing**: Taking two input addresses, converting them to geographical coordinates, and then displaying a route between them on the map.

## Contents

1. `geolocation.html`: Demonstrates the geolocation capability.
2. `routing.html`: Demonstrates the routing between two addresses using Leaflet, OSRM, and Nominatim.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open `geolocation.html` in a browser to see the geolocation demonstration.
3. Open `routing.html` in a browser and enter two addresses to see the routing demonstration.
